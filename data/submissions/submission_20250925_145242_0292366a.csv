0292366a,Simulation methodology of pyrolysis stage in PIP process of SiCf/SiC composites,Yunlu He - Tongji University (Presenting); Ying Dai - Tongji University (Corresponding),Yunlu He (Tongji University),Ying Dai (Tongji University),"Advanced Manufacturing & Processing Techniques (Additive Manufacturing, Composite Manufacturing Methods)","Among the fabrication methods of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), the polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP) has been widely adopted for industrial applications for its low cost, adjustable preparation temperature and ability to produce components in complex shapes. The PIP process involves impregnating the fiber preform with a liquid polymer precursor at a certain temperature and pressure, followed by curing and pyrolysis in a vacuum or an inert gas atmosphere, converting the polymer precursor into a ceramic matrix.However, PIP often induces residual pores and microcracks caused by incomplete infiltration and matrix shrinkage during polymer-to-ceramic conversion. These defects result in high porosity and require multiple processing cycles to achieve sufficient densification. To investigate the mechanisms and evolution of intra-bundle and inter-bundle cracking during pyrolysis, this study develops a multi-scale sequentially coupled simulation framework that integrates heat transfer, pyrolysis kinetics, and mechanical damage across different scales. At the macroscale, temperature distribution and ceramic conversion are resolved and subsequently transferred to meso- and microscale models of woven fiber structures. At finer scales, stress evolution and damage progression are simulated using a phase-field fracture approach, providing a unified description of crack initiation and propagation induced by shrinkage stresses. This framework enables explicit representation of microscale cracking behavior during pyrolysis, bridging the gap between kinetic characterization and structural damage modeling. The results provide a theoretical foundation for understanding defect formation mechanisms in PIP processing and offer guidance for material design and process optimization of CMCs.",N/A,,,2311370@tongji.edu.cn,+86 19821235016,N/A,N/A,Not needed,none,N/A,2025-09-25 14:52:42,en
