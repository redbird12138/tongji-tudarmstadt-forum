03c9664a,Comparing Powder Bed Fusion and Direct Energy Deposition for Oxide-dispersion Strengthened Steels: A Simulation Study,"Somnath Bharech - TU Darmstadt  (Presenting, Corresponding); Yangyiwei Yang - TU Darmstadt ; Bai-Xiang Xu - TU Darmstadt",Somnath Bharech (TU Darmstadt ),Somnath Bharech (TU Darmstadt ),"Advanced Manufacturing & Processing Techniques (Additive Manufacturing, Composite Manufacturing Methods)","Oxide-dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels, which contain oxide nanoparticles (NP) dispersed in a metallic matrix, demonstrate excellent high-temperature strength. The mechanical performance of these materials can be tailored by controlling the size and distribution of the dispersed NP. This study employs thermal-melt-microstructure—coupled phase-field simulations and subsequent nanoparticle tracing to analyze the thermo-microstructural evolution, melt flow characteristics, and in-process NP dispersion and agglomeration in Fe20Cr alloy system with 0.5 wt.-% ZrO2 NP, processed using laser-based additive manufacturing (LAM) techniques such as powder bed fusion (PBF) and direct energy deposition (DED). The simulations offer insights into dispersoid characteristics, including size and interparticle distance, which are essential for determining strengthening through Orowan mechanism—information that is typically inaccessible via experimental methods.
The results reveal significant differences in the melt flow patterns and melt residence times between the two processes. Consequently, the NP dispersion is influenced by their position relative to the melt pool geometry. Regions closer to the beam spot center experience longer melt residence times and higher degree of dispersion resulting in larger interdispersoid distances, and lower estimated Orowan stress. At equivalent volumetric energy density, simulations indicate larger melt pool and more stable melt flow pattern in DED, resulting in better NP-dispersion, whereas the erratic melt dynamics in PBF lead to greater NP agglomeration. Subsequently higher Orowan stress is estimated for DED as compared to PBF. This study highlights the importance of process selection in optimizing ODS steel performance and lays the groundwork for further investigation into multi-layer effects during LAM.",N/A,,,somnath.bharech@tu-darmstadt.de,N/A,Somnath Bharech,V9534293,"October 12, 2025 (Sunday); October 13, 2025 (Monday); October 14, 2025 (Tuesday); October 15, 2025 (Wednesday); October 16, 2025 (Thursday)",vegan,N/A,2025-09-26 09:12:51,en
