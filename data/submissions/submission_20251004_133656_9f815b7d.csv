9f815b7d,Achieving Outstanding Mechanical-Acoustic Integrated Properties Through Hypercube Lattice Materials,"Fan Yang - Tongji University (Presenting, Corresponding); Lingbo Li - Tongji University; Puhao Li - Tongji University",Fan Yang (Tongji University),Fan Yang (Tongji University),"Multifunctional Materials and Smart Systems (Energy Materials, Ferroelectric Materials, Metamaterials, Phononic Crystals)","I will talk about a new type of lattice metamaterials called hypercube metamaterials inspired from the four-dimensional Tesseract in science-fiction film. A typical hypercube lattice cell is featured by a nested hybridization composed of an inner simple-cubic (SC) unit and an outer body-centered-cubic (BCC) unit. Three variants of the hypercube metamaterials are presented, i.e., truss-based, plate-based, and truss-plate hybrid variants. Through appropriately adjusting the geometric parameters, multifunction integration can be achieved. The truss-plate hybrid hypercube metamaterial can integrate high energy absorption and excellent vibration attenuation utilizing the local resonance mechanism, while the pure plate-based hypercube metamaterial excels in load-bearing and sound absorption due to the formation of multiple Helmholtz resonant cavities. This talk aims at providing new pathways for the design of multifunction-integrated lightweight metamaterials with outstanding adaptability to different working conditions.",N/A,,,fanyang@tongji.edu.cn,N/A,N/A,N/A,Not needed,none,N/A,2025-10-04 13:36:56,en
